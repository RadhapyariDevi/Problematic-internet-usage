# Problematic-internet-usage 

This model predicts the level of problematic internet usage exhibited by children and adolescents, based on their physical activity. analyzes children's physical activity and fitness data to identify early signs of problematic internet use. Kaggle dataset was used to train this model, which includes physical activity, screen time, sleep patterns, and behavioral attributes. It aims at identifying early signs of problematic internet.
